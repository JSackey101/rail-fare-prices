utilities.py contains the function read_rail_network which loads a dataset containing station data (e.g. in uk_stations.csv) and creates a RailNetwork object containing Station objects for each station.

railway.py contains the code needed to produce both Station objects and RailNetwork objects which can be used alongside the fare_price function to estimate rail fares within a rail network.

Repository contains tests made for the functions I made in both railway.py and utilities.py in test_railway.py.
